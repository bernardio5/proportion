///// For some geometric constructions, some components are used many times.
// rather than repeatedly add those components to the figure,
// use a "rig" to generate them once and then use them many times.

// the rig is just an array of integers; it remembers the element
// places in the figure



// the "grid" takes a triangle and draws sets of lines || to two of its sides,
// all crossing the ||ogram the triangle defines.
//  yeah, rectillear grid

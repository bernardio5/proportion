This is the proportion library README. 

This library enables constructive geometry in JavaScript. 
I like geometric constructions. Drafting also is cool. 
Tile patterns: cool. Islamic decorative tiled patterns: coool.

The code in proportion.js is heavily commented. 
The HTML pages in the baseExamples directory are a tutorial.

Yeah, AirBnB style... I'll think about it. 

The base library is only two classes, and they're pretty tightly coupled. 
There is a library of standard constructions, in progress-- what you learn
in High-School geometry. 

Next, a library for manipulating repeating patterns and symmetries. 
Then, fonts.

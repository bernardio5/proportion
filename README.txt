This is the proportion library README. 

This library enables constructive geometry in JavaScript. 
I like geometric constructions. Drafting also is cool. 
Tile patterns: cool. Islamic decorative tiled patterns: coool.

The code in proportion.js is heavily commented. 
The HTML pages in the baseExamples directory are a tutorial.

There is a library of standard constructions, in progress. 
Next, a library for tiling patterns. Then, fonts.

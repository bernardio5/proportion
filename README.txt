This is the proportion library README. 

This library enables constructive geometry in JavaScript. 
I like geometric constructions. Drafting also is cool. 
Tile patterns: cool. 

The code in proportion.js is heavily commented. 
The HTML pages in the "examples" directory are a tutorial.
The code in "prMachines.js" is a set of connom geometric constructions. 

Next up is testing/debugging of lofting, and modification of how 
color is controlled. Then, on to tiling.

This is the proportion library README. 

This library enables constructive geometry in JavaScript. 
I like geometric constructions. Drafting also is cool. 
I intend to have font capabilites; that's in progress.

The code in proportion.js is heavily commented. 
The HTML pages in the baseExamples directory are a tutorial.

Yeah, AirBnB style... I'll think about it. 
The base library is only two classes, and they're pretty tightly coupled.

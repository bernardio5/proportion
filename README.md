JavaScript constructive geometry without trigonometry


The contents of the main directory are a series of HTML pages that illustrate the use of the library. 
The index.html page is the root of these pages. 

It's not yet in the usual JavaScript object style; sorry, I got a strange template. 
I intend to change to something closer to the airBnB style. 

Goals: I just like Euclid, you know? The "input/figures" directory contains some images that inspired me. 
I want to be able to build geometric constructions for their own sakes. I did intend to continue until 
fonts could be built, but I got sidetracked by life-- there's also a complexity issue! So I need
some inspiration on how to hide font-description complexity.

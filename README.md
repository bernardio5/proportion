JavaScript constructive geometry without trigonometry


The contents of the baseExamples is a set of HTML pages that illustrate the use of the library. 
The index.html page is the root of these pages. 

It's not yet in the usual JavaScript object style; sorry, I got a strange template. 
I intend to change to something closer to the airBnB style. 

Goals: I just like Euclid, you know? The "input/figures" directory contains some images that inspired me. 
I want to be able to build geometric constructions for their own sakes. I did intend to continue until 
fonts could be built; an outline of TBD items is in that directory. 

And the "examples" directory will demonstrate constructions from different sources.
